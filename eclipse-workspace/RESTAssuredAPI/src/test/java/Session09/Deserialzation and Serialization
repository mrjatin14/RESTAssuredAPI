"Deserialize" the JSON Response
Serialization and Deserialzation are programing techniques. where we convert-

obj--> BYTE Streams(Serialization)
Byte Streams --> object respectively (Deserialzation)


what is Serialization and Deserialzation a JSON response?
Serialization is process of converting data obj into a stream of data (JSON Data). obj--->JSON is serialization

the reverse process of Serialization ( stream to obj) is Deserialzation. JSON Data--> object is called Deserialzation

this convertion is platform independent.
