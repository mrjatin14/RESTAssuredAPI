what is Plain Old Java Object (POJO)?
Plain Old Java Object  is a class which used for object representation of  structured data(JSON).This class contains 
all the keys as nodes and provides getters and setters to add the abstraction layer.
so basically when we have data in JSON format and that  data we have to represent in object form then w'll use POJO.

advantages
